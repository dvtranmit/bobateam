You may be trying to describe a RAM in a way that is incompatible with block and distributed RAM resources available on Xilinx devices, or with a specific template that is not supported. Please review the Xilinx resources documentation and the XST user manual for coding guidelines. Taking advantage of RAM resources will lead to improved device usage and reduced synthesis time.

INFO:Xst:2117 - HDL ADVISOR - Mux Selector <status> of Case statement line 342 was re-encoded using one-hot encoding. The case statement will be optimized (default statement optimization), but this optimization may lead to design initialization problems. To ensure the design works safely, you can:
   	- add an 'INIT' attribute on signal <status> (optimization is then done without any risk)
   	- use the attribute 'signal_encoding user' to avoid onehot optimization
   	- use the attribute 'safe_implementation yes' to force XST to perform a safe (but less efficient) optimization
