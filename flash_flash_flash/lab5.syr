INFO:Xst:2117 - HDL ADVISOR - Mux Selector <status> of Case statement line 340 was re-encoded using one-hot encoding. The case statement will be optimized (default statement optimization), but this optimization may lead to design initialization problems. To ensure the design works safely, you can:
   	- add an 'INIT' attribute on signal <status> (optimization is then done without any risk)
   	- use the attribute 'signal_encoding user' to avoid onehot optimization
